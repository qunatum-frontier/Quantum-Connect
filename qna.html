                        I usually tell most people to start by learning algebra and calculus, then move into learning basic physics. 
                        <br><br>When it comes to deciding which concept to learn, it all comes down to your end goals.
                        <br><br>If you want to get into quantum computing professionally, here's another tip: start by looking up dream job listings, see what skills/experience they're looking for, and then use that to reverse-engineer what you should learn.

                        Free tools are great for dipping your toe into the water to see if you like the concept. While there are some great free resources out there ,like our website, oftentimes you get what you pay for. Paid resources are likely to be much easier to use and understand.

                        To be a good at something , there are no shortcuts. That is not the right way to think about it :) <br><br> Instead, you should take time mastering the fundamentals. This will help you in the long run.It’s important to focus on the fundamentals first. <br><br>Learning isn’t something that can be rushed. It’s exactly the same as learning a new language. It takes time to master, but it’ll be worth it once you do.
