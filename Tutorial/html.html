    <h2 id="q">What are quantum gates?</h2>
    <p>
        Quantum gates are the fundamental operations in quantum computing, just like classical logic gates are for regular computers.  They act on qubits, the quantum bits that hold information, and manipulate their quantum states. Unlike classical bits which are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This ability, along with entanglement (linking qubits), unlocks the unique power of quantum computers.
        <br/>

There are various types of quantum gates, each performing a specific task.<br/> Some common examples include:

<li>Hadamard Gate: Puts a qubit in an equal superposition of 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Pauli-X Gate: Flips a qubit's state (0 to 1 or vice versa).</li>
<li>CNOT Gate: Controlled NOT gate, performs a NOT operation on one qubit based on the state of another.</li>
<br/>
These gates can be combined to create complex quantum circuits that perform calculations. The power of quantum computing comes from the ability to manipulate qubits in superposition and exploit entanglement. By carefully designing sequences of quantum gates, scientists can tackle problems that are intractable for classical computers.
