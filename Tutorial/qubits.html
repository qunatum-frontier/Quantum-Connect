    <h2 id="q">What are Qubits?</h2>
    <p>
        A qubit, or quantum bit, is the fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing but with unique quantum properties. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist simultaneously in multiple states (superposition). This allows it to represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, greatly increasing computational power.

        <h3>Key Properties of Qubits:</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>Superposition: A qubit can be in a combination of the 0 and 1 states simultaneously. This is represented as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, where α and β are complex numbers defining the probability amplitudes of the states.

            </li>
            <li>Entanglement: Qubits can become entangled with each other, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This property is crucial for quantum communication and quantum computing.
